This is a project started by Brian Riordan in 2023. Users with access to either Max/MSP, Ableton Live Suite, the abilty to use customized patches, abstractions, externals, or Max for Live devices. Users with access to RNBO can build their own VST or AU audio plugins for free to use on their own DAW. 

The purpose of this project is mostly educational. However, some of the basic patches or VSTs here are designed with "DAW agnosticism" in mind. If you have access to fundamental mixing plugins, then it doesn't matter which DAW you use.

### Basic Utility Effects

These effects are modelled after the Ableton Utility aduio effect. Inspect the patchers to see how it is built. The benefit of having access to these effects as a VST is that they can be used in any DAW, and you can decide on the placement and order of these effects. Additionally, these can be used as externals or abstractions in Max/MSP.  

[br.utility.gain.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.gain.1.0)  A basic utility effect that allows the user to adjust the volume of a stereo signal. The decibel range is from -72 dB to +35 dB. -72 dB is converted to negative infinity dB. 

[br.utility.mute.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.mute.1.0)  A basic utility effect that allows the user to simply mute a signal

[br.utility.mono.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.mono.1.0)  A aasic utility effect that sums a stereo signal into mono with 3 different mix settings

[br.utility.monobass.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.monobass.1.0) A basic utility effect that allows the user to sum frequencies below a cutoff to mono while leaving frequencies above in stereo
 
[br.utility.stereo.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.stereo.1.0)  A basic utility effect that allows the user to adjust mix of a stereo signal, such as swapping, left only, right only, mid, or side. Additionally, the user can adjust the width or the pan of the resulting signal.

[br.utility.stereomix.1.0](https://github.com/guaguanco127/br.utility.stereomix.1.0) A basic utility effect that allows the user to mix the individual stereo channels independently. In addition to invert settings, the user can adjust the gain and the panning of each channel.
