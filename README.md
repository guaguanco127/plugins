These plugins are available as VST3 for Mac and Windows, and AU for Mac. 
Abstractions for Max/MSP, and Max for Live devices also included. 

All versions of these plugins were created in Max/MSP using RNBO 

Max/MSP version 8.5.6
RNBO 1.2.3

## About

The initial intention to build these plugins comes from the perspective of DAW agnosticism, or the belief that there is no such thing as the perfect DAW. If users have access to the same basic mixing plugins, then it doesn't matter which DAW they would use. Additionally, these plugins are presented in a way so that programming novices can learn to build their own plugins. Many of the plugins included in this project includes multiple versions. VST, AU, Max/MSP abstractions, Max for Live devices, and RNBO versions are provided so that users could see how each version is built. 

However, since starting this project I also hoped to include more complex audio processing possibilities. You will also find unique plugins (eg, Stutter, or the delay plugin) that will provide different FX that can only be found here. 

## Future Plans

For now, the GUI of these plugins are the default from RNBO. Eventually, the plan is to include customized GUI into all versions of plugins. 

Additionally, I plan to include a "basic" version of each plugin (as many are missing the basic version) along with more detailed comments on all versions.
