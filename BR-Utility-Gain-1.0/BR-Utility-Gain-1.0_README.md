These plugins are available as VST3 for Mac and Windows, and AU for Mac. 
Abstractions for Max/MSP, and Max for Live devices also included. 

All versions of these plugins were created in Max/MSP using RNBO 

Max/MSP version 8.5.6
RNBO 1.1.2

BR-Utility-Gain-1.0 from 10-29-2023

A basic audio plugin for adjusting the volume of a stereo signal. 
The decibel range is from -72 dB to +35 dB.
-72 dB is converted to negative infinity dB.
Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth. 

Instructions on installation for each version included below. 

-------------------------------------------------


For VST3, find the folder where your DAW finds all of your plugins. 
Copy and paste the compatible version.

For Windows use BR-Win-Utility-Gain-1.vst3 
For Macintosh use BR-Mac-Utility-Gain-1.vst3 or BR-AU-Utility-Gain-1.component

--------------------------------------------------

For Max/MSP, create a patch inside a folder. Then copy and paste br-utility-gain-1.0.maxpat inside of that folder. Create a new object with the name br-utility-gain-1.0 and you can use it as an object in your main patch. 

This abstraction was created using gen~ 

The basic version of this abstraction is called br-utility-gain-basic-1.0.maxpat
It has the same functionality but uses MSP instead of gen~
The purpose of the basic version is for beginners to be able to learn how to program using Max/MSP, and to compare and contrast the same concept in gen~ 

The br-utility-gain-rnbo-1.0.maxpat version is designed for those who want to learn from, or observe the RNBO methods I used to create all of these plugins.
